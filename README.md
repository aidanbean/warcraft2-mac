# ECS160OSX
ECS 160 Project OS-X Version

Rules for creating a branch:
Name your branch after the file/feature you're working on. 
Ex: Call you branch:  GameDataTypes if you're working on GameDataTypes.swift

Delete your branch after it is approved and pushed to master, so our project is lightweight, and clean. 

For now we're gonna put all the *.swift files under WarCraft2 folder.


Is this ok with everyone?
